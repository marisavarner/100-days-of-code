# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 4: July 27

**Today's Progress**: Started a JAMstack portfolio site with Nuxt.js. Tried to add Netlify CMS, but had issues deploying. Will need to revisit the docs before continuing with this project. Specific issues were whether the Netlify CMS files should be installed in the static or dist directory. Didn't find much discussion on forums.
